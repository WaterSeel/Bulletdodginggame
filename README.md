# Bulletdodginggame
This is a game I developed with a partner in my first term at univsersity. The premise is that the player controls a dot on a dot <br>matrix display, and must dodge the falling lights to survive as long as possible. <br>
The microcontroller is an STM32Nucleo board. The display is a MAX7219 8x8 dot matrix display. The controls are a pair of buttons connected via breadboard to the microcontroller.
